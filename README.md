# MERN Stack Notes App with Authentication

![MERN Stack Notes App](screenshot.png)

This repository contains a Notes App built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The app allows users to securely store, delete, and update their own personal notes. It incorporates user authentication to ensure data privacy and security.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely. Authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for enhanced security.
- **Create Notes**: Authenticated users can create new notes with a title and content.
- **View Notes**: Users can view a list of their own notes, each displaying the title and a preview of the content.
- **Update Notes**: Users can edit and update the title and content of their existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Users have the ability to delete their own notes when they are no longer needed.
